Matthew Perry and Ryan Leveck's submission for University of Washington Bothell's 2023 hackathon.

SportLink is a website for finding, creating, and joining pickup basketball games in your area.

The website allows users to join existing games in their area as well as create their own. Each of these games has various info, including location, skill level, and current attendance that helps people find the games they are interested in. The website is currently a prototype. While we do not have a back-end, the website displays how SportLink would function and how the user could interact with it. We plan to add a back-end in the future to make the website fulfill its goals.

We used JavaScript, React, Leaflet, geolocation API, SoftVC VITS Singing Voice Conversion AI, HTML, and CSS to create the website.

Hackathon Information (Entertainment Track):

1. We chose to do the entertainment track and our goal was to create a website that fit with the theme of in-person events after quarantine. We decided on pickup basketball because it is something that allows people to get active and connect in-person with others who enjoy playing the sport.
2. Since the website is a prototype without a back-end, the website provides an introduction to the experience we want users to have. It demos the basic functionality of SportLink and allows for users to try out the key features. We plan to build on these by adding a back-end, an account system, dedicated text channels for each event, and the ability to filter by various criteria when searching for events.
3. We used JavaScript, React, Leaflet, geolocation API, SoftVC VITS Singing Voice Conversion AI, HTML, and CSS to create the website. When building the website, we started off with the join a game section and host a game section. The join a game section was made with React and the host a game section was made using Leaflet. Throughout making website, we started off each section by creating the HTML and JavaScript, and then focused on the CSS after everything was finished. We used the so-vits-svc AI to create celebrity endorsements for our website and the geolocation API to determine what area the user is located in.
4. We had difficulty tailoring the Leaflet library to our project goals. After reading through the Leaflet documentation and developing a plan, we were able to successfully integrate the Leaflet interactive map. Another challenge was getting the information that was entered when hosting a game to appear in the list of nearby games, while also maintaining the same format as the existing games in the list. We found that using ChatGPT to help us debug and find mistakes in our code helped speed up this process and allowed us to develop our solution in a more timely manner. Working with the mentors was also really helpful in getting more insight on the technologies that we were using and helped us to overcome the additional challenges that we had.
5. We want to add a back-end so that the website will be fully functional for people to use. Some other features that we think would be essential is having an account system, dedicated text channels for each event, and the ability to filter by various criteria when searching for events.
